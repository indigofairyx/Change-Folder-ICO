## Load from folder tabs menu ** Special Menu For [Directory Opus](https://www.gpsoft.com.au) Users
This menu allows you to load open tabs that are open in DO without changing windows to copy the paths.

If you're DO user there's a [post on the forum](https://resource.dopus.com/t/change-folder-ico/54858) with a button I made to send folders to CFICO from DO with one click!
